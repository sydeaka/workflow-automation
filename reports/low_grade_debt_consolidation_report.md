# Predicting Adverse Outcomes for Debt Consolidation Loans {.tabset .tabset-fade}



## Introduction 

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform based in the U.S. On their website, they regularly publish datasets that include attributes about the customer and loan that are collected at the time of application or during the debt repayment window. 

These datasets are quite popular among Kaggle competitors and other data science enthusiasts. For additional information about Lending Club, visit any of the links below.

In this report, we share the results of a modeling exercise in which we attempt to predict adverse outcomes for Lending Club loans to be used for debt consolidation purposes. The dataset used for this exercise are related to loan applications processed in **2017, Quarter 2**.

## Dataset {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The 2017 Q2 dataset consisted of 105451 records. Selected Lending Club attributes were joined to state-level population summaries to produce the modeling dataset.  For the analysis, we focused on the 58557 loans for debt consolidation. Late payment, default, or charge-off loan statuses were flagged as adverse (undesirable) outcomes.

A sample of 100 rows is provided in the following table.
