# Predicting Adverse Outcomes for Debt Consolidation Loans {.tabset .tabset-fade}



## Introduction 

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform based in the U.S. On their website, they regularly publish datasets that include attributes about the customer and loan that are collected at the time of application or during the debt repayment window. 

These datasets are quite popular among Kaggle competitors and other data science enthusiasts. For additional information about Lending Club, visit any of the links below.

- Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club
- Website: https://www.lendingclub.com
- Datasets: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

In this report, we share the results of a modeling exercise in which we attempt to predict adverse outcomes for Lending Club loans to be used for debt consolidation purposes. The dataset used for this exercise are related to loan applications processed in **`r year`, Quarter `r quarter`**.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Report updated `r Sys.time()`.

## Dataset {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The `r paste(year, ' Q', quarter, sep='')` dataset consisted of `r overall$num_records` records. Selected Lending Club attributes were joined to state-level population summaries to produce the modeling dataset.  For the analysis, we focused on the `r analysis_subset$num_records` loans for debt consolidation. Late payment, default, or charge-off loan statuses were flagged as adverse (undesirable) outcomes.

A sample of 100 rows is provided in the following table. 
<br>
<br>

```{r}
set.seed(147)
id_sample = sample(1:nrow(dat), 100)
dat_sample = dat[id_sample,]
rownames(dat_sample) = NULL
```


```{r, results='asis'}
datatable(dat_sample, caption='Lending Club loans for debt consolidation (data sample)') 
```


## Descriptive summaries {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The data consisted of a mix of numerical and categorical attributes and only a few missing values. 

- The most popular type of loan was `r purpose_nm`, comprising `r purpose_msg` of all loans. 
- Most of the loans received a grade of B or C. 
- Loan amounts for debt consolidation ranged from `r loan_range` dollars (U.S.). 
- Interest rate increases as grades decrease from A to G.

## Modeling {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Training, testing, and validation percentages were `r splits_msg`, respectively. Model details are provided in the tabs below.

<br>

### AutoML

We allowed the AutoML model search algorithm to run for `r parameters$run_time` seconds, fitting a total of `r nrow(leaderboard)` models. Model `r lead[,"model_id"]` had the highest cross-validated AUC (`r lead[,"auc"]`).  
<br>
<br>

```{r, results='asis'}
datatable(leaderboard, caption='AutoML leaderboard') %>% formatRound(colnames(leaderboard), 3)
```

### LIME

The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm was used to provide some insight into the variables that contributed to the model predictions of a few selected loan cases.
